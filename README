PINOCHLE README
---------------
Pinochle is a trick-taking card game typically for two to five
players and played with a 48 card deck. Derived from the card 
game bezique, players score points by trick-taking and also by 
forming combinations of cards into meld. It is thus considered 
part of a "trick-and-meld" category. Each hand is played in 
three phases: bidding, melds, and tricks.
